# IMDb-Analysis
In this project, I will analyze IMDb Dataset using SQL. IMDb is the world's most popular and authoritative source for movie, TV, and celebrity content. I leveraged data to analyze specific movies from the IMDb database and visualize them to compare their ratings and votes to the current year and genre, hopefully identifying movie market trends for that year.
